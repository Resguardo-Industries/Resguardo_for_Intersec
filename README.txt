This Resguardo for Intersec, a simple design built around a grid of large, colorful, 
semi-interactive image tiles (of which you can have as many or as few as you like).
Makes use of some SVG and animation techniques I've been experimenting with on that other project of mine, 
and includes a handy generic page for whatever.
